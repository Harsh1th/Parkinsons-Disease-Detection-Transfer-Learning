# Parkinson's Disease Detection Transfer Learning

**About**

Parkinson’s disease is often associated with movement disorder symptoms such as tremors and rigidity, making it harder to draw smooth spirals and waves. These can have a noticeable effect on the handwriting and drawing of a person suffering from early stages of the disease. According to some studies it might be possible to detect Parkinson’s disease using the drawings alone rather than having to measure the speed and pressure of the pen on paper. The researchers found that the drawing speed was slower and the pen pressure lower among patients , this was especially pronounced for patients with a more acute/advanced forms of the disease.
